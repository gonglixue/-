Experiments of Computer Animation course in 2015 autumn-winter term.
All the programs are based on Qt 5.0
# Ex1
Realizing the algorithm of Cardinal curve interpolation
# Ex2
Realizing the algorithm of vector linear interpolation, which can better adapt to rotation transformation.
# Ex3
Using arc length instead of using interpolation parameter to control the animation of object, so that can better imitate uniform speed movement or accelerating movement.
